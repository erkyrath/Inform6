This is an obsolete source tree for a never-released "Inform 6.40",
found at http://www.seebs.net/tmp/cvsroot.zip.

This was based on Inform 6.31, and worked on (sporadically) from
2003-2006, it looks like. Primary contributors were rfirth, cknight,
dkinder.

This tree was abandoned when Inform 7 came into play, and its changes
did not make it into the Inform 6.32 that is now supported with I7.

I am saving it in this branch for historical reasons. Some of the
changes will probably be adapted into the live Inform 6.3x release
stream, but I think any such imports will have to be carried over by
hand. There's been too much divergence for a simple source-control
merge, and I don't like all of the changes anyhow.

I've added two files to this directory:

* fork-cvs-log -- the CVS changelog that came with the CVS archive.
* fork-change-notes -- my (Zarf's) notes about what all the changes do.
